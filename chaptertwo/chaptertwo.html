               <p>I can't help but to cry out what's lost. I'll forever have regrets and guilts in life. You are my life, you are my dream come true yet, I still had a chance to messed up everything. I know you wouldn't dare to give "us" another chance but, I hope you find someone better than me, a man who will make you the happiest girl, partner, wife and mother. Someone you will love better, the man of your dream, someone that can take care of you when you're sick, will pray for you every night and will not leave you the time when fate was no longer in favor.. Not just someone who can afford to settle. Because if not, it will break my heart again.. 'coz I know and I still believe in myself that I can give the love that you want. "Kung sukatan lang ng pagmamahal alam kong panalo ako. Marami pa 'kong kayang patunayan at ibubuga na hindi pa sinusubok ng tadhana". You were once not safe with me and I didn't protect your heart but, it doesn't mean I'll hurt you forever. The good thing with me is that.. I always choose to win back love than giving it up. That's why you cannot blame me for why I'm still fighting for your love. I still want you to realize that my heart's still pure and sincere. Just remember how we start, why you loved and chose me. Because everyday since day 1, I love you better than yesterday.</p>
